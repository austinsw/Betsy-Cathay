# Betsy-Cathay

Cathay Hackathon GROUP 60 - The Fly Free Team

Betsy is a sample Discord bot that helps people research the locations of their travels. This was a project I submitted when I participated in Cathay Hackathon 2021.

**Note that the bot is developed on Replit, so the libraries used are Replit specific!**

Users can interact with Betsy by searching for local tourist attractions and the bot will give description or advice for the places of their interst. A Covid-19 waring alert will also be given out if the destination is being affected by the pandemic. Users can also receive 500 Cathay Points for providing useful information regarding the site or pandemic situation after verification.

(To keep the bot alive 24/7 on Replit for free, [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) can be used to ping web server. Although this feature is not implemented in my code of this porject but in other Discord projects.)
